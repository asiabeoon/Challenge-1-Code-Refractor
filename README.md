# Challenge-1-Code Refractor-Html-CSS


## Description

In this Project I was given a Starter code for a webpage. The goal is to make the webpage more accessable for the viewers and future programmers who may view the code.  This required me to make changes to the HTML/<index>  and to the CSS Stylesheet.

I looked at the elements and made them semantic, changed the title, inserted links in the header and matched those changes in CSS. My motivation was to look at the html and CSS stylesheet and discover how these work together. I learned how HTML and CSS work together.
